# Collections-DT
Dependently-typed implementation of common collections with an emphasis on type-safety.

Heavily inspired by [the standard collection library of Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/index.html), this library intends to demonstrate the power of dependent types in practical programming.
